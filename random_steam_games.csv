Through use of the game's flowchart system, players navigate through the story and uncover clues to unravel the mysteries of Urashima, the titular island. The story of ISLAND revolves around Sanzenkai Setsuna, a young man who wakes up on the shore of Urashima with no memories of his past. During the game, you'll explore Setsuna's relationship with three girls on the island, Rinne, Karen, and Sara. As he uncovers the hidden secrets of Urashima's past - and future - Setsuna must fight against fate to protect that which he treasures most. Will you be able to discover the truth and save Urashima, or find yourself lost among the ISLAND's many dead ends? World and Background Urashima is a small island, far from mainland Japan. It's a true utopia, blessed with rich natural beauty. But the island harbors a difficult past, and it's about to be erased, silently, from history. Soot blight syndrome, an endemic disease, has brought about a rift between the island and the mainland. An offshore platform intended for marine research has long been left abandoned; five years ago, three separate incidents brought the once influential Three Families of Urashima to near ruin. Rumors about children being spirited away have become part of the local folklore, alongside another legend, one that has been repeated on the island since time immemorial... 'Let me tell you the legend of this island: it's a story of tragic love...' The key to saving the island lies with three girls, each of whom belongs to one of the Three Families. These girls aren't able to change the fate of the island by themselves, but might they succeed with the help of the young man who's just washed ashore? Claiming that he's traveled back in time, the man immediately sets out on a lonely path, challenging the longstanding traditions of the island, and seeking to change the future. But those aren't his only goals... How will his presence transform the lives of these three girls, the future of the island, and the fate of the world...?","['English', 'Japanese', 'Simplified Chinese']","['Japanese', 'Simplified Chinese']",,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/857450/header.jpg?t=1618480328,http://never-island.com/game/index.html,,ask@frontwing.co.jp,True,False,False,0,,0,1145,45,,0,980,,1102,0,2121,0,Frontwing,Frontwing USA,"Single-player,Steam Trading Cards,Steam Cloud","Adventure,Casual","Visual Novel,Anime,Story Rich,Adventure,Cute,Time Travel,Casual,Mystery,Sci-fi,Sexual Content,Romance,Choices Matter,Multiple Endings,Singleplayer,Psychological Horror,Dating Sim,Drama,Horror,Nudity,Great Soundtrack","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/857450/ss_74b0d83402ad5379ac85c0aedc1fd8dd578feef0.1920x1080.jpg?t=1618480328,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/857450/ss_40913a1fb7d86b737973910de18ac589bfce87ec.1920x1080.jpg?t=1618480328,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/857450/ss_ccf59004ede58c608b7f8ee1784a584c1992c723.1920x1080.jpg?t=1618480328,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/857450/ss_b97258bb2b510e8057e82b28e7a37a7b106b0ba1.1920x1080.jpg?t=1618480328,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/857450/ss_cbdde0a7016e848b46ba49c86ad3b9bad298e582.1920x1080.jpg?t=1618480328,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/857450/ss_e60162ac376255169eb9e71b1ac3fa67064a9278.1920x1080.jpg?t=1618480328,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/857450/ss_8d945852ff7df78bfa97e8087d8c81ba271a2bb4.1920x1080.jpg?t=1618480328,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/857450/ss_e1ecd3da5b7ce28eb2d783f968969f88e1cad986.1920x1080.jpg?t=1618480328,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/857450/ss_f64db59976ce2623e74ffe9dd53f47ec71b73a14.1920x1080.jpg?t=1618480328,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/857450/ss_8759b3aa22397f2911ef11d745a48c638fc9a6b8.1920x1080.jpg?t=1618480328,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/857450/ss_967948621859d31cc33a4d12ba254a0e5825cfb7.1920x1080.jpg?t=1618480328,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/857450/ss_ba5d66e2e34a0ff8c18dd14f0b1a84017661dcbf.1920x1080.jpg?t=1618480328,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/857450/ss_3690d493f21c46e93556461441c0781dd1c35faf.1920x1080.jpg?t=1618480328",http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256720262/movie_max.mp4?t=1530850084

This could not stop the Union armies pressing on through North Carolina, capturing Fayetteville, Bentonville, Goldsboro and Raleigh by mid-April. Exhausted by the Union siege of Petersburg and Richmond, Lee’s forces made a last attempt at resistance, attacking and capturing Fort Stedman on March 25. A rapid counterattack reversed the victory, however, and on the night of April 2nd the Confederate army finally evacuated Richmond. For most of the next week, the Union army pursued the Confederates along the Appomattox River, exhausting any chance of escape. Grant accepted Lee’s surrender at Appomattox Court House on April 9th. Sherman accepted Johnston’s surrender at Durham Station, North Carolina on April 26th, finally ending the American Civil War, and to slavery in the United States of America.

1918970,Eresys,"Apr 20, 2023",0 - 20000,0,0,8.09,0,"Eresys is an online co-op/offline singleplayer horror game inspired by H.P Lovecraft which focuses mainly on teamwork. A party of 4 players face together the fears of the Lovecraftian Universe. Featuring smart AI mechanics with horrifying entities that will make you regret stepping into the forest. Only by working together and using the order of the occult will you be able to stand a chance. Visuals - Immersive environment with delicate presentation of monsters and characters. Story - After being expelled from the cult, a deranged former member has opened a Void Portal on a secluded island, unleashing horrific entities that have already claimed the lives of many. You and your fellow cultists must work together to send the entities back to where they came from and seal the portal to prevent further destruction. To accomplish this, you must locate and gather the resources needed to make offerings at the altars and perform the final ritual. Time is of the essence, can you and your team complete the task before the entities overrun the island and unleash their terror on the world beyond? Smart AI - Those entities are not your typical kind of “Monsters”. They will calculate all your choices and actions. This will also have an immediate impact on their AI and create new ways to devour you. Unexpected Events - It could be a small coin or an idol, anything that is linked to the occult that could trigger a surprising and unexpected event. You never know what is hiding behind each item. Safe Houses - Houses and other buildings can provide temporary safety. Hidden lootable items and resources can be found, which you will need to complete the final ritual. Caves - Caves can offer a brief respite from danger and a source of resources, but be wary - they may also conceal sinister surprises. The Book - Players must decide who carries the powerful tome, the book of the order, which can banish the ancient entity once it is complete. Pages - The book of the order has missing pages, to complete the final ritual, you will have to gather every missing page. Victims - The enchanted victims and other resources can be found around the island which was used by the cultist. You have to gather their blood and fill your vials with it. The Oil Lamps - The Entities have been in the void for eons and they are not familiar with the Light. Stick together with your teammates with at least 2 lamps lit. This will be one of the many ways to keep them at a distance. Remember that you will need oil to refill the lamps. Altars - Altars are a manifestation from the necroworld summoned by the expelled cultist. Offer them blood and they will reward you with blood spheres.","['English', 'Spanish - Spain']","['English', 'Spanish - Spain']",,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1918970/header.jpg?t=1682020016,,https://twitter.com/EresysTheGame,,True,False,False,0,,0,0,0,,6,0,"Eresys contains occult/dark ritualistic themes, acts such as sacrifices, worship, blood and death can be seen throughout the game.
